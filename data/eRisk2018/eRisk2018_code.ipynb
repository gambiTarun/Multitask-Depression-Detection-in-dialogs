faction in the game and the best companion too ', ' you realize you can get them to form a pact with whoever you join right ', ' you could try a sorcerer with the dragon character build if you have the player s guide ', ' o holy shit that is the best idea i have heard all year probably because we are still pretty early in the year but i applaud you good sir ', ' thanks that is very helpful ', ' well i would do that but these are players from different circles that do not care much for the other the people in the first group play mostly to hang out with each other and i doubt they would like to play without each other i know ten players is over any good limit but we make it work even if combat takes an eternity thank you for your suggestion though ', ' i have a current game going and am just getting out of my beginner stage myself as i learn more and read more of the rules but i have encountered a problem i have two friends that have heard i play and are interested in starting out and i would allow them to join my current campaign but it already has about ten players and that is excluding the dm i would gladly get a new game going for this different group of friends but that gets me into a new problem i would like at least three players for a well rounded party for me to dm so they enjoy the game to its full capacity i have a couple friends that i could potentially get to join but there is a huge change they will dismiss it as hugely nerdy the second d d comes out of my mouth how exactly could i propose the idea to increase the chances of them being interested if you actually read that entire thing i applaud you by the way tl dr how can i get people to join my campaign that would enjoy the game but might dismiss it and laugh if i do not present it well out of fear of it being too nerdy ', ' well i am a student at a fairly small school and this might seem odd but the students gossip with the teachers more than often it goes from anything as serious as students being suicidal to as petty as so and so like so and so so the teachers at least at my school are fully aware of it but as i said i go to a very small school and it is almost always dealt with quickly and effectively ', ' i am a high schooler in utah this sounds cool and i am in anyone willing to exchange ', ' you got it ', ' pronounce tyranny correctly i pronounce it tie ran y because dang it that is how it is done ', ' a girl loses her head ', ' high schoolers disobey school rules ', ' ', ' that is certainly problematic sorry to hear it ', ' well i always start all of my cities with a monument and than focus on getting production and food than to all out on wonders legalism in the tradition tree makes this automatic in first four cities and if your playing cultural that would mean more than all of your cities to cities can work but i ideally play with two this means you have to know how to play really tall this means you need a lot of food and production in these cities to make them power houses that can fuel all of your needs ', ' yeah moving up takes a lot of practice ', ' well in the early game that sounds great but it takes a long while to make i would make sure you have an adequate production before you make it as not to fall too far behind too early ', ' wait are you playing g k i play that and i do not care too much about faith mostly because i am not very good at it to be honest so i typically ignore stonehedge i think the oracle sistine sydney and cristo redentor are absolutely necessary though i typically attempt to get as many other wonders as possible but they take second place compared to cultural buildings and having a functional military ', ' well at this point it seems your in quite an emergency scenario i only play on prince so far but sometimes in scenarios like that you just have to put everything else on the back burner for a minute and get as much tech and production as you can for the moment without causing any long lasting damage with techs until things start going your way rush it to the best military units you can get your hands on and than quickly catch up once your done with the war ', ' personally and i could be wrong i would say egypt i would say wonders are one of the most important things in a culture play through and the bonus from egypt gives you a huge head start on their production times and building them in general ', ' well personally i think city state bonuses are amazing during a cultural victory but city states are tricky and you need to focus more on building up culture than gold so focus on building up your own culture and if you have the extra stuff city states add a huge bonus ', ' i know a lot of people struggle with cultural victories in civ but they come very naturally to me if you would like any help with this victory type please ask me anything you would like to know ', ' wow that is a really great turn of events ', ' that is certainly impressive ', ' ha that is even better ', ' that is great ', ' x d my friends to critical fails too i love that rule ', ' that is an epic comeback ', ' i have heard a lot of epic moments from my friends they play a lot but that takes the cake by far ',

time ', ' what is the greatest moment that just stuck with you that happened during d d it might be a memory your greatest victory or maybe your worst defeat or maybe something different entirely i have not been playing for very long so i do not really have one yet but i would like to hear what you have to say ', ' that is pretty great ', ' well i have a friend that continuously tries to intimidiate his way out of any scenario at first i would let him do it without consequence but i eventually got mad and after he intimidated a king guards swarmed him and he ended up in the hardest fight of the campaign ', ' angel beats ', ' that is probably true ', ' huh maybe it was just our session or something that was weird ', ' thank you that is very interesting ', ' i played an adventure on we rolled ones probably of the time am i the only one with this problem ', ' i recently asked r dnd for advice on the campaign i was about to start i just did the first game of it yesterday and it went very well mostly due to all of you who gave me advice thank you very much the player s enjoyed the game but said i need to make combat a lot shorter and faster one fight lasted the majority of our three hour session but everyone enjoyed it nonetheless the setting worked but i would like to hear some input on how to improve it the current setting is in a massive city called blackburn with a really nice area and a ghetto different sections are ruled by different dukes the city is overrun with disease and the players discovered that one of the dukes is a wererat in charge of a lycanthrope army they thwarted his plans and kicked him out of his thrown but he is still alive and likely to make a comeback tl dr i was wondering two things on how to keep improving this campaign how can i improve the setting and what should i add to it what is a good way to make combat faster ', ' well said ', ' how do you feel about the lego related deaths in history ', ' i do not think that is possible for anyone that is not a robot are you a robot how did you get past the thing that makes you type in the letters you see ', ' thanks i am playing e by the way ', ' thanks i will be sure to look over my rulebooks again ', ' holy crap that is amazing and even better it fits exactly into the campaign pieces of plot i had already thanks ', ' i will keep that in mind thanks ', ' i am new to d d i have played about times dming about three i asked my friends that i play with if i could dm a full campaign i am not a superb or even great dm by any standard but they agreed i really need advice on how to do this i only vaguely have a world made and only vaguely have a plot your help is greatly appreciated ', ' yeah i love rping as a tiefling so much ', ' my group always makes it so a nat does damage to you or your allies this is not taken very seriously and often leads to hilarious situations like an orc launching its sword at it is kobold friend it is also one of the best moments to see the look on your friend s face as you roll a damage die to see how hard you hit them ', ' i am a teifling wizard with a really bad past and a nasty habit of doing things rather questionable be it killing innocence to achieve a goal or accidentally striking my teammates there is a half elf ranger who the dm loves to have monsters be swooned by which drives her nuts all in good fun of course there is a human warlord that has a rude manner and is always looking to get in the npc s way even if it is a friend finally there is a dwarf fighter that chargers into battle and never looks back has no regard to strategy most rules or any premade plan ', ' i am an american considering living in japan when i am older i am currently a high schooler and i went there for a week last year is it a good place to study abroad would you recommend living there i do not speak any japanese but i am fairly good with languages is the language particularly difficult sorry for all the questions in one ', ' well in the first ever encounter we played my players accidentally burned down the old tower they were in and watched it burn as their short rest from that point on they have become kind of a fire team and burned up almost all of their enemies and on occasion each other also turning enemies shields into fun house mirrors in order to stun ', ' aaaah my fire sword it is on fire ', ' i have heard multiple say they want the removal of the karma system because it makes them feel guilty about their actions which should not happen in a video game am i the only one that things the consequences of your actions and how the game plays out based on your decisions is actually something good am i the only one that savors the feeling that i screwed up and honestly have fun living the consequences of my actions or am i just playing this game wrong ', ' that is because you are have you ever seen the actual play or just movies that makes a huge difference ', ' jackass i hate those ', ' wow thank you ', ' well i have two stories from my school although i guess they were not just for amusement but they were entirely made by the teachers so there are two teachers at my school that do interesting things the first is a fourth grade teacher to demonstrate that racism sucks she sets aside everyone with blue eyes until the end of the day they have to sit at the back of the classroom cannot go to recess sit at the back of the lunch line ect ect ect the students do not have a clue what is going on until the teacher explains that this is how racism works and why it sucks the other teacher is teaching th graders about the revolutionary war one day the teacher dons a crown to class and makes everyone call him the king he starts charging them to do mundane things a penny to go to the bathroom a quarter to go to recess cents to bring a water bottle a quarter for a pencil and they are not allowed to bring pencils to class anymore ect ect ect on top of this he starts to ignore basically anything the students request he than makes them write a constitution and declaration of independence to free themselves i always thought this was great ', ' tooele high school ', ' first do no harm ', ' ah good point ', ' as someone knew to d d and someone incredibly tactically minded i simply do not see the problem with meta gaming now do not get me wrong i am not trying to say it is

driving purposes we decided to just spend the night out at saltair which is where the concert was a lot of people have died there in its history be it from drug overdose the three fires or the several times it flooded i got curious always one interested in the paranormal and headed into a room where i knew a rockstar had overdosed once i pulled out a voice recorder and did my first impulse starting singing the next day was an angels and airwaves concert and so i started singing that by the time i reached one of the last lines of the song i felt something strange a hand reaching up and touching my face like i honestly through my friend was there messing with me but i looked and no one was there i would love to say i stuck around like the manly man i wish i was but i left quickly when i listened to the voice recording the next day there were drums playing along with the melody of the song still have no idea why any of that happened but if it was a ghost i am proud to say i rocked out with a dead rock star at my school we use laptops a lot all of the students are required to have one also they give everyone an email under our school website which has quite a nice firewall as i will call it this firewall prevents anything from getting in or out you cannot email anyone outside the gmail community and the outside community cannot contact that email ever but over the last couple days strange emails have been arriving from weird adresses they are always under a name that occurs exactly twice in the united states they always say something like hello honey or good morning darling or something of the sort i tried to email one back and it said the adress did not exist now i know what you are thinking idiot kid got a virus from a spam bot well no i personally checked

cyre every captain all slaughtered by the mourning the characters find their way out of the place protected by a dragonmark branded onto their skin in an explosion moments before the mourning the were on a rescue mission to save two people a spy named ir gadden and a noble named blackwood they succeeded but just barely after wading their way through a sea of emerald claw agents four years later old wounds reopen the characters are invited to live in sharn by ir gadden now an extremely wealthy government official in breland on their first day in sharn they attend a remembrance ceremony where they are attacked once again by the emerald claw led by blackwood after this they come onto the radar of house jorasco a representative tells them the house is on a hunt to cure to mournland and they think finding the because of it is the first step they tell the players there is were several emerald claw agents on the day of the mourning and that this might have some correlation naturally the next stop for the players is karrnath on the way there their train is attacked by goblins whom they liberate from their cruel necromancer masters the goblins swear their allegiance and join the players on their quest when they arrive in karrnath the players find themselves under attack by the emerald claw the mysterious leader of this organization has ordered the players deaths after several adventures involving this the characters enter the paragon tier in which everything gets serious the characters are invited to a ball in the castle of the king of karrnath who is actually a vampire after a run in with a medusa at the party and a human lich in the dungeon the players find out the king s secret and kill him in his dying word they learn the mourning did have a lot to do with karrnath but not as much as it to do with a secret coalition made of members of house cannith and the leaders of the emerald claw a good place to start might be the religion called the blood of vol among these people the characters find and kill lady vol learning the mourning was an event caused by the bronze lich and her god venca they did it to gain enough souls to use necromancy to make an army capable of destroying the world and for all intensive purposes they are on track to succeed unhindered in their final adventures the characters hunt the bronze lich through the planes eventually killing her and

cold spiteful women who fuck shit up for men and that is the vast majority of the female representation lucatiel is cool i am going to and the daughter of manus in the ivory king dlc goes a long way

department in ds the story is centered around a macro story without too many sub stories besides npcs ds is the opposite with the stories of many kingdoms being told throughout the game the lore is more thematically based and has a stronger human element as opposed to godly forces that being said the story occasionally has less strong bits and also struggles with a fair bit of sexism if you ask me although that is not the case with every character also there is some dumb dark edginess that is occasionally eye roll worthy but once again this is not always the story is also built around themes of disappointment degradation and loss so expect the game to pull some crazy tricks on you gameplay wise it is not as hard as ds it includes a lot of easy buttons for players that want them like npc summons that make things incredibly easy if you do not take those easy buttons it is very intense and difficult though pvp and co op wise it is a million times better more viable builds faster and

ask a few questions about moderation first of all thanks guys i did not expect this sub to get more than say twenty subscribers needless to say i am shocked impressed and overjoyed that you guys want to find cool underrated games with me as is stated in the sidebar this sub is directly inspired by extra credits and i would very much like to stay true to that inspiration and so i would like this sub to be focused on two things fun and intelligent design in these games that is what we are looking for i would love this sub to act as a place to discuss these games from a design perspective as well furthermore along with ec i would like this to be a community united in the idea that games matter that being said no game should just be written off even the worst games are worth learning from so no bashing in the comments please and toxicity and elitism of any kind is not going to be tolerated that is non negotiable so let us love on to some questions i have no idea how to run a subreddit and have very little time to moderate so i would like to turn to you guys when problems arise and hope you guys want to sort them out and make this a better subreddit i guess the first problem we should probably take care of is what defines a game you might not know obviously a few of us or even a lot of us sometimes will know about a game on this subreddit that nonetheless deserves or needs more publicity so we cannot just write off everything we have heard of however we do not want this sub to become a shithole of wannabe hipsters saying omfg hav you herd of mincraft so i think it would be best for us to come up with some solid empirical rules here is a few i thought of games that can be seen on or were recently featured on the front page of steam will be rejected games that have sold more than no fucking clue what number should go here units will be kicked out immediately games that have been featured in a popular gaming magazine or review site will be terminated thoughts oh

maybe the rule should be if you know less than two people personally who know what this game is go ahead and post it although that creates its own host of t know i will think about it i do not want

studies please do not hate me thanks i am going to be totally honest and say that i am pretty sure this subreddit is kind it has some ideas mixed up maybe a little delayed in their timeline their timeline states that modernism was sort of the advent of seeking trough through science but actually modernism was a very specific break from that mentality it rebelled against the truth seeking enlightenment thinkers and discussed subjectivity for examples see nietzsche sartre or literary examples such as woolf or faulkner even joyce all as evidence that the modernist movement was largely about subjectivity of truth which the subreddit claims is the idea that postmodernism focuses on if we remember way back to the idea channel episode on community we find that postmodern is about meta narratives which is what most of this subreddit seems to be discussing if you ask me which you probably should not because i am just an english major whose knowledge of philosophy is mostly surface level i would say that post postmodernism does exist in the world and that there are several philosophical and artistic movements rebelling against postmodernism in the same way that postmodernism rebelled against modernism before it and so on and so forth into philosophical history ad infinitum but it seems more like this subreddit is filled with postmodernists who are a little confused about

middle of nowhere there are two houses nearby one of which we share a fence with otherwise it is just farms as far as the eye can see one day extended family and all were hanging out there when we heard a scream and a gunshot i cannot be certain of what exactly went down because i was in the basement my uncle a veteran ran down into the basement where i was taking care of the younger kids i was about sixteen at the time and told me to stay down there and away from windows me and my brother and our cousins pretty much cowered in fear in the basement until my dad came downstairs and told us it was okay to come up there were a shitload of police officers at the house next door turns out the lady next door had locked her daughter in her room and held the husband at gunpoint for a few hours before she noticed her daughter escaping through the window she shot them both and then was killed by the police she had the highest bac i had ever even heard of at about blood alcohol content nothing strange happened immediately but the next time i went up there i noticed footprints leaving the house as i was leaving they appeared to be that of a goat which i thought was weird considering they went neatly up the stairs as if they had been walking on two legs i put that aside as a trick of the light which i still sort of do to be honest the next time my family went up there things were weirder the entire place smelled fucking awful and there were scratch marks everywhere i immediately assumed a cat had gotten in but then i found handprints on the basement walls as if someone had had their hand covered in soot and pressed it against the wall furthermore everyone there acted very uncharacteristically my family which usually got along very well broke out in several fights and one of

debating the nature of mary as a character the three theories that came are first that the children are just imagining mary poppins as magical the second is that mary is a fairy in the irish folklore sense and the third is that mary is hestia greek goddess of the hearth and family note this theory is centered around the play not the movie although they are very similar so i think it applies to both mary clearly demonstrates magical powers in the play she can fly and possesses the ability to control others such as when she forces ms andrews to drink the brimstone and treacle this is also noted when the children tell her she must have put the idea to let them visit the bank into their father s head and she laughs she also brings the toys and statues to life and consistently forces the children to and from sleep by snapping these powers could be attributed to the imagination of the children but i would argue otherwise considering she actually forces ms andrews to both drink her tonic and leave when the statue of neleus comes to life it tells the children mary is an old friend of his father s we later learn that his father is poseidon god of the sea this would go a long way to explaining mary s powers i would like to think this comment means that mary is part of the greek pantheon given that she knows poseidon but that leaves the question of which character she is we know that mary goes from broken family to broken family and mends them this would hint at hestia goddess of family furthermore the symbol for hestia is the hearth or fireplace the fireplace in the banks household is not a plot point but is mentioned multiple times and is a centerpiece of the set at least in the original broadway and london runs of the play furthermore and more obviously the image of chimneys is pretty consistent throughout the play bert himself is a chimney sweep and the children and especially mary spend quite a bit of time around the chimneys on the rooftops if we are willing to accept chimneys as a substitute imagery wise for the fireplaces themselves that brings even more relevance to the hearth and a further link to hestia ', ' sounds just like a certain milo
